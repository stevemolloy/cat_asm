# Cat in ASM

This is a simple exercise to reproduce the "cat" executable that you find on most Linux distributions.

The challenge is to write it purely in x86_64 ASM.

Right now it works in the sense that it takes in a list of files as command line args, and outputs the contents of those files one by one.

## Todo
1. Handle command line flags
1. Handle stdin
